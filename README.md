# 🌍 COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Optimizer

This project explores the global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines using a **Genetic Algorithm** to optimize delivery routes from a single origin to every country in the world. It combines **AI-driven optimization**, **data visualization**, and **web interfacing** to model and present feasible, equitable vaccine delivery strategies.

## 🚀 Overview

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, equitable distribution of vaccines posed a significant global logistics challenge. This project simulates a solution using **evolutionary algorithms** to minimize delivery time and maximize efficiency with a limited number of aircraft.

The project includes:
- A **Genetic Algorithm** to evolve optimal delivery paths.
- A **Django web interface** for interaction and display.
- **Matplotlib visualizations** to illustrate routes and improvements over time.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🌐 Global country graph modeling
- ✈️ Aircraft routing with cargo constraints
- 🧬 Evolutionary optimization with customizable parameters
- 📊 Graphical visualizations of the best routes and performance over generations
- 🕸️ Web dashboard built with Django to visualize and interact with the simulation
